# Boredom (Pre-Alpha 0.3)

A tiny two-player sandbox prototype. Drag platforms, jump around, and… experiment.  
Built with vanilla JS (ES modules), HTML, and CSS.

> ⚠️ Pre-Alpha: systems are in flux; this is a playground, not a finished game.

---

## How to Play (No Spoilers)

- **Player 1:** `W` `A` `D` (move/jump)
- **Player 2:** Arrow Keys (move/jump)
- **Palette:** drag blocks into the world to build platforms
- **Eraser:** toggle, then click things to remove them
- **Reset:** reloads the current level

Some interactions are **discoverable**. If something feels weird… try it again. 🙂

## Run Locally

Because this uses ES modules and fetches JSON levels, run it with a static server:

**Option A (VS Code):**
1. Install the “Live Server” extension
2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

**Option B (Python 3):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000

```

## Project Structure (short)

```
index.html
styles/
  main.css
src/
  main.js           # boot + game loop
  config.js         # tunable constants
  state.js          # shared runtime state
  fx.js             # effects (glitch, burst, etc.)
  input.js          # keyboard handling
  LevelManager.js   # loads JSON levels, builds DOM
  entities/         # Player, future entities
  systems/          # Movement, Collision, Clamp, Erase
  ui/               # dialogue (center box), HUD bits
  data/             # dialogue lines
  levels/           # level1.json, level2.json
```

* **Data-driven** levels (JSON)
* **Frame-rate independent** physics (dt-based)
* **Modular** systems (easy to swap/tune)

## Features (kept vague to avoid spoilers)

* Local **two-player** platforming
* **Drag-and-drop** building blocks
* An **eraser** with escalating feedback
* Ambient **UI dialogue** that reacts to play
* Small **visual effects** that ramp up under certain conditions

---

## Versioning

This repo uses tags for stable points.

* Current: **Pre-Alpha 0.3**
* Create your own savepoints: `v0.3.1`, `v0.3.2`, …

If you’re experimenting, branch first, then PR or merge back when stable.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **White page / nothing moves:** you’re likely opening files directly. Run a local server.
* **404 on modules/JSON:** check **relative paths** (e.g., `./src/ui/dialogue.js`, `./src/levels/level1.json`).
* **Laggy movement:** keep the tab focused; dt is capped but background tabs throttle timers.

## Contributing

Bug reports and PRs welcome. Please keep issue titles specific (e.g.,
“Dialogue box doesn’t cancel on reset while level auto-resets”).

> Note: Some interactions are intentionally undisclosed here. Use spoiler tags in issues if needed.
